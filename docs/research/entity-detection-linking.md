## Long-tail in Entity linking

* [EL-long-tail-phenomena](https://cltl.github.io/EL-long-tail-phenomena/): Systematic study of long tail phenomena in the task of entity linking. 
* [LongTailAnnotation](https://github.com/cltl/LongTailAnnotation): Annotation tool for data2text approaches
* [LongTailIdentity](https://github.com/cltl/LongTailIdentity): Generating profiles of long tail identities from text 

### SemEval2018
* [LongTailQATask](https://cltl.github.io/LongTailQATask/). Code for SemEval-2018 task \#5 "Counting events and participants in the long tail".
* [SemEval2018-5_Postprocessing](https://github.com/cltl/SemEval2018-5_Postprocessing): Postprocessing steps for the SemEval-2018 task 5: Counting events and participants in the long tail

## Human-Like EL

* A human-inspired Entity linking system in progress can be found in the repository [HumanLikeEL](https://cltl.github.io/HumanLikeEL/) 
* [HELAnalysis](https://github.com/cltl/HELAnalysis): Analysis of the Human-like Entity Linking system

## More on Entity Linking

* [ELBaselines](https://github.com/cltl/ELBaselines): This repository aims at creating baseline results for Entity Linking, by running a text against the state-of-the-art systems for entity linking, using their most standard configuration.
