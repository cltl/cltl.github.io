## OpeNER Corpus
 In the [OpeNER project](http://www.opener-project.eu/project/), we have created a [corpus](https://cltl.github.io/OpeNER_corpus/) of news articles and hotel reviews annotated with opinion expressions, holders, targets and their relations.

## Opinion Mining
The [Opinion Miner Deluxe ++](https://github.com/rubenIzquierdo/opinion_miner_deluxePP) is an improved version of the [first version of the opinion miner](http://cltl.github.io/opinion_miner_deluxe/) based on machine learning that can be trained using a list of KAF/NAF files.

## Emotion Detection
[this repository](https://cltl.github.io/EmotionTagger) contains code to score emotions and expressiveness in text.
