title: Event Detection and Coreference
---

## Event detection

* The [TimeMLEventTrigger repository](https://cltl.github.io/TimeMLEventTrigger) contains conversion scripts and models to automatically extract event triggers following the TimeML Annotation Guidelines.
* [CatFrameNet](https://github.com/cltl/CatFrameNet)
* [ceopathfinder](https://github.com/cltl/ceopathfinder): Finds a path of circumstantial relations between events on the basis of the CircumstantialEventOntology
* [FrameNet-annotation-tool](https://github.com/cltl/FrameNet-annotation-tool): Python-based command-line tool for FrameNet annotation
* [nwr-semeval2018-5](https://github.com/cltl/nwr-semeval2018-5): NewsReader participation to task 5 of SemEval2018
* [OntoTagger](https://github.com/cltl/OntoTagger): Ontotagger inserts (semantic) labels into KAF representation on the basis of lemma or wordnet synset representations of text
* [TimeMLEventTrigger](https://github.com/cltl/TimeMLEventTrigger)
* [TripleEvaluation](https://github.com/cltl/TripleEvaluation): This program evaluates text mining output from text on the basis of a triple representation.

## Event coreference

* [coreference-evaluation](https://github.com/cltl/coreference-evaluation): Evaluation package for event coreference using the reference-scorer
* [EventCoreference](https://github.com/cltl/EventCoreference): Compares descriptions of events within and across documents to decide if they refer to the same events. Also converts NAF to GRASP-RDF and SEM-RDF.
* [reference-coreference-scorers](https://github.com/cltl/reference-coreference-scorers): This is the reference implementation of commonly used coreference metrics.
* [sem10scorer-stability](https://github.com/cltl/sem10scorer-stability): Testing the stability of sem10scorer
